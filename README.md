# Todo

A lightweight, minimalistic, crossplatform Todo list application.

Special thanks to [Nomad Coders](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUpJs89fSBXNolQGOYKn0YQ) for help on this project.

# Setup

1. Ensure you have React installed.
2. Open a terminal window and run `npm install -g expo-cli`.
3. In the same terminal window, run `cd src` then run `yarn web`.
4. Your browser should open with a developer dashboard for the app, select the platform you want to run the app on in the bottom left.
